# CSV Filter Challenge
- This project was written in Python
- There is a test CSV file provided in the `CSVFiles` folder

## How-To
1. Clone the repository
2. Open your terminal and locate the `CSVFilter.py` file
3. Once the file is located in terminal run `py CSVFilter.py`
4. A test CSV file is provided for the CSV file input which is `test.csv`    
- **Note: You can add additional CSV files in the `CSVFiles` folder**

## Assumptions
- Only one CSV file will run at a time and it's decided by user input
- The CSV file has data in correct order and formatted correctly
- Uppercase and lowercase first/last names are filtered the same
- All date ranges are acceptable input
- Filtering first/last names gives only exact matches. For example, an first name input of "Rob" will not include "Robert" in the filter
